                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician known for his extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite having little formal training, his raw genius and self-taught insights have made him one of the most celebrated mathematicians in history.</p>

            <h3>Key Contributions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed groundbreaking results in number theory, including the Ramanujan prime and the Ramanujan theta function.</li>
                <li>Made significant contributions to the study of infinite series and continued fractions, including the discovery of many rapidly converging infinite series for π.</li>
                <li>Formulated the famous Ramanujan-Hardy number, 1729, which is known as the "Ramanujan-Hardy number" for its intriguing properties in number theory.</li>
                <li>Introduced the concept of mock theta functions, which have had a profound impact on modern mathematics and mathematical physics.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="formulas">
            <h3>Famous Formulas:</h3>
            <div class="formula">π = 2√(2) * ∑(k=0 to ∞) [(4k)!(1103 + 26390k) / (k!)⁴ 396^(4k)]</div>
            <p>This formula for π, discovered by Ramanujan, rapidly converges and is among the most famous series for calculating π to high precision.</p>
