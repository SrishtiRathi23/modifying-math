        <div class="fun-facts">
            <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At the age of 7, Gauss demonstrated his extraordinary mathematical talent by summing the integers from 1 to 100 in seconds, which amazed his teacher.</li>
                <li>Gauss's work on the normal distribution and statistics led to the popular Gaussian distribution, which is widely used in probability theory and statistics.</li>
                <li>He contributed to the development of the heliotrope, an early instrument for measuring the positions of stars, which helped advance astronomical observations.</li>
