                    Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and author who is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time. 
                    He made groundbreaking contributions to calculus, optics, and gravitation. Newton's work laid the foundations for much of modern science and mathematics.

                    Born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, England, Newton is most famous for his work in physics, but his contributions to mathematics are also monumental. He developed the principles of calculus (independently of Leibniz) and formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which are still fundamental to physics today.

                <li>Invention of calculus (independently of Leibniz).</li>

            <h3>Mathematical Formulas:</h3>
            <p>Newton made significant contributions to mathematics, one of which is the <strong>Binomial Theorem</strong>:</p>
            <p class="formula"> (a + b)<sup>n</sup> = ∑<sub>k=0</sub><sup>n</sup> C<sub>n</sub><sup>k</sup> a<sup>n-k</sup> b<sup>k</sup> </p>
            <p>
                Newton's second law of motion states: <strong>F = ma</strong> (Force equals mass times acceleration).
            </p>
            <p>
                Newton's law of gravitation: <strong>F = G (m₁m₂ / r²)</strong> (Gravitational force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them).

                <li>He was a very private person and never married.</li>
                <li>He spent a considerable portion of his life studying alchemy, trying to turn base metals into gold.</li>
                <li>Newton invented the first practical reflecting telescope, known as the "Newtonian Telescope".</li>
                <li>He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705.</li>
                <li>Newton once stated, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants," referring to the work of previous scientists.</li>

            <h3>Newton's Legacy:</h3>
            <p>
                Isaac Newton's work revolutionized the understanding of the physical world. His principles of motion and universal gravitation changed the way we understand the universe. Newton's work laid the foundation for classical mechanics, which was later built upon by scientists such as Albert Einstein in the 20th century.
