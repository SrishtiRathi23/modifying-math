                    Bhaskara I was a 7th-century Indian mathematician and astronomer who made significant contributions to mathematics, particularly in trigonometry and number systems. 
                    He was one of the earliest mathematicians to write about the works of Aryabhata and helped propagate Indian mathematical concepts across the world.

                <p>
                    Bhaskara I is best known for his accurate approximation of the sine function and his pioneering explanations of mathematical principles without using symbolic algebra.

            <h3>Mathematical Formulas:</h3>
            <p>Bhaskara I provided an approximation for the sine function:</p>
            <p class="formula">sin(x) ≈ 4x(180 - x) / (40500 - x(180 - x))</p>
            <p>
                This approximation was highly accurate for its time and was used in various astronomical calculations.
