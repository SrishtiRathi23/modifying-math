                <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His contributions to science were groundbreaking and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.</p>
