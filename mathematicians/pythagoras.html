                <p>Pythagoras was an ancient Greek mathematician and philosopher best known for the Pythagorean theorem, which relates to the sides of a right triangle. Although he did not leave any written records of his own work, his ideas and discoveries have influenced mathematics, philosophy, and science for centuries.</p>

        <div class="key-contributions">
            <h3>Key Contributions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Formulated the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle: a² + b² = c².</li>
                <li>Contributed to the development of number theory, particularly in the study of integers, ratios, and the concept of mathematical proof.</li>
                <li>Advanced the idea that numbers and mathematical relationships underpin the nature of the universe, influencing later developments in mathematics and science.</li>
                <li>Explored the concept of harmony in music, showing that numerical ratios could explain musical intervals.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="formulas">
            <h3>Famous Formulas:</h3>
            <div class="formula">Pythagorean Theorem: a² + b² = c²</div>
            <p>This fundamental relation in geometry shows that the square of the hypotenuse (c) of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b).</p>

        <div class="fun-facts">
            <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pythagoras is believed to have founded a religious movement, the Pythagorean Brotherhood, which combined mathematics, philosophy, and spiritual practices.</li>
                <li>The Pythagorean theorem is one of the most famous theorems in mathematics and has countless applications in geometry, architecture, and engineering.</li>
                <li>Despite being known for his mathematical contributions, Pythagoras also contributed to the development of early philosophical and metaphysical ideas about the relationship between numbers and the universe.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="legacy">
            <h3>Legacy:</h3>
            <p>Pythagoras' contributions to mathematics have left an enduring legacy. The Pythagorean theorem is a cornerstone of geometry, and his insights into numbers and ratios influenced the development of number theory and mathematics as a whole. Additionally, his ideas about harmony in music and the role of mathematics in understanding the natural world have had a lasting impact on science and philosophy.</p>
